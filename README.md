# Library Management System
Library management software for monitoring and controlling the
transactions in a library. This project is designed & coded in
Netbeans7.4 & database management is handled by MySQL 5.5. This
software mainly focuses on basic operations in a library like adding new
member, new books, and updating new information, searching books and
members and facility to borrow and return books.

My software is easy to use for both beginners and advanced users. It features a
familiar and well thought-out, an attractive user interface, combined
with strong searching insertion and reporting capabilities. The report
generation facility of library system helps to get a good idea of which
are the books borrowed or returned by the members.

## This software has four main modules:
1. Insertion to Database Module – User friendly input screen
2. Extracting from Database module – Attractive Output Screen
3. Report Generation module – Borrowed book list & Issued book
list
4. Search Facility system – Search for books
